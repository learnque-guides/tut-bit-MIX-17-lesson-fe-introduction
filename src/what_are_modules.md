# What are modules?

* Our application can consist of different modules that can be split to store their own set of components and logic.
* Modules are a great way to organize the application, for example Angular’s own libraries are organized as modules. ☺
* Every Angular app has at least one module – the AppModule. As the app grows, it might make sense to split it into feature modules.
