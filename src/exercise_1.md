# Exercise 1

1. Add a route of type `/dog/:name` in your app.module.ts.
2. When a user clicks on the dog name in your application, a details page for your dog should
be shown.
3. At this point you can add additional fields to your Dog objects. How about a link to the picture of the dog? Or perhaps its age or color? Display this data on the details page.
4. If you are up for an additional challenge, add the form to edit your dog details on the Details page.
5. Do not hesitate to also add some shiny SCSS to your web page so that your page is looking extra good.
